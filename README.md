# BigInt Operations Showcase

Welcome to the BigInt Operations Showcase repository! This project demonstrates the capabilities of BigInt class operations through an interactive web-based interface. Whether you're preparing for an interview, showcasing your skills, or simply exploring large number computations, this project offers a compelling demonstration.

# Features

- Factorials: 
Compute factorial of numbers up to 100.

- Fibonacci Numbers: 
Generate Fibonacci sequence up to the 100th number.

- Catalan Numbers: 
Calculate Catalan numbers up to the 100th number.

- Responsive Design: 
The web interface is responsive and works seamlessly across devices.

# Getting Started

To get started with the BigInt Operations Showcase:

- git clone https://github.com/SachinMaurya2002/BigInt-Operations-Showcase.git

- Navigate to the project directory:

cd bigint-operations

- Open index.html in your web browser:

Simply open index.html in your preferred web browser to see the BigInt operations in action.

# Usage

Upon opening index.html, you'll see a neatly formatted display of BigInt operations.

Scroll through to view factorials, Fibonacci numbers, and Catalan numbers calculated dynamically.

The animations and styling enhance the user experience, making it visually appealing.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the web page.

- CSS: Styling for aesthetics and responsiveness.

- JavaScript: Dynamically calculates and displays BigInt operations.

- C++: Backend computations using BigInt class (not directly visible in the web interface).
